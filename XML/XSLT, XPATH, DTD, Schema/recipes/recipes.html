        oven till bubbly.

<li>vanilla extract | 2 | teaspoon</li>
<li>semisweet chocolate chips | 0.25 | cup</li>

<li>baking powder | 5 | teaspoon</li>
<li>white sugar | 1 | cup</li>
<li>shortening | 0.5 | cup</li>

</ul>
<ol>
<li>
          Combine the flour, baking powder, and 1 cup of the sugar together. Cut in the
          shortening and mix until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Mix in 4 of
          the eggs and 1 teaspoon of the vanilla. Divide dough into 4 balls and chill (if
          needed).
        </li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>milk | * | <ul></ul>
<ol></ol>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<b>Preparations:</b>
<li>
        Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease two deep dish pie
        plates.
      </li>
<li>
        Roll out 2 of the balls to fit into the pie pans. Do not make the crust too thick
        as it will expand during cooking and get too thick. Do not flute the edges of
        the dough. Roll out the other 2 balls of dough and cut each into 8 narrow
        strips for the top of the crust. Alternately you can use cookie cutters and
        place the cutouts on the top of the pies.
      </li>
<li>
        Pour the filling evenly into the pie crusts. Top each pie with 8 narrow strips
        of dough or cookie cut-outs. Brush top of pie with milk for shine. Place foil on
        the edge of crust.
      </li>
<li>
        Bake at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) for 20 to 30 minutes then remove
        foil. Continue to bake for another 25 or 30 minutes or until a knife inserted in
        the center comes out clean.

<b>Ingredients:</b>
<li>egg yolks | 4 | <ul></ul>
<ol></ol>
</li>
<li>milk | 2.5 | cup<ul></ul>
<ol></ol>
</li>
<li>Savoiardi biscuits | 21 | <ul></ul>
<ol></ol>
</li>
<li>sugar | 0.75 | cup<ul></ul>

<ol></ol>
</li>
<li>fresh whipping cream | * | <ul></ul>
<ol></ol>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<b>Preparations:</b>
<li>
        Warm up the milk in a nonstick sauce pan
      </li>
<li>
        In a large bowl beat the egg yolks with the sugar, add the flour 
        and combine the ingredients until well mixed.
      </li>
<li>
        Add the milk, a little bit at the time to the egg mixture, mixing well.
      </li>
<li>
        Put the mixture into the sauce pan and cook it on the stove at a medium 
        low heat. Mix the cream continuously with a wooden spoon. When it starts
        to thicken remove it from the heat and pour it on a large plate to cool off.
      </li>
<li>
        Stir the cream now and then so that the top doesn't harden.
      </li>
<li>
        Dip quickly both sides of the lady fingers in the liquor. Layer them one 
        at the time in a glass bowl large enough to contain 7 biscuits.
      </li>
<li>
        Spread 1/3 of the cream and repeat the layer with lady fingers. Finish 
        with the cream.

<h3>Cailles en Sarcophages</h3>
</span><span>Fri, 28 May 04</span>
<ul>
<b>Ingredients:</b>
<li>pastry |  | <ul>
<li>chilled unsalted butter | 15 | ounce</li>
<li>flour | 3 | cup</li>
<li>salt | 1.5 | teaspoon</li>
<li>ice water | 0.75 | cup</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
          In a large bowl, cut 6 tablespoons of the butter into the flour with 
          a pastry blender until the butter is more or less incorporated. Now 
          coarsely cut the remaining butter into the flour mixture, leaving many 
          visible pieces of butter (about 1/4 inch in diameter should be fine).
        </li>
<li>
          Dissolve the salt into the ice water. Slowly drizzle the salted water 
          into the flour mixture while tossing gently with a fork. When all the water
          has been evenly distributed, there will remain many dry crumbs. Don't worry.
        </li>
<li>
          Empty the dough out onto a large piece of plastic wrap. By folding up the 
          four sides of the wrap and pressing, form a rectangle of dough. Roll the
          dough out just a bit and fold the sides over the middle, forming a piece 
          one third the former size. Repeat, this time folding the top and bottom
          to the middle. The butter and flour will not yet be working in harmony, so 
          you will probably have to use the plastic wrap to aid you in the first
          few folds.
        </li>
<li>
          Puff pastry requires a somewhat Calvinist submission of the will and a 
          confidence that layers will appear. Roll the dough out again and repeat the
          folding, lightly dusting with flour between every layer. Discard the plastic 
          wrap as soon as the dough holds together on its own.
        </li>
<li>
          The dough will become progressively softer as you work on it, with an almost 
          springy texture. After 6 or 10 repetitions of the folding and rolling, cut the 
          dough into 18 equal pieces. Wrap each well in plastic wrap and let rest in the 
          refrigerator for at least 2 hours.
        </li>

<li>filling |  | <ul>
<li>baked chicken |  | </li>
<li>sauteed mushrooms |  | </li>
<li>sauce |  | </li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
          Combine the sauce with the chicken and mushrooms.
        </li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>package phyllo dough | 0.5 | package<ul></ul>
<ol></ol>
</li>
<li>egg whites, lightly beaten | 3 | <ul></ul>
<ol></ol>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<b>Preparations:</b>
<li>
        Cut the stack of phyllo sheets in half and lay between two damp, clean 
        towels. Lightly dust with flour and roll each of the 18 pieces of dough 
        to a diameter of 6 to 8 inches. Set aside.Place about 1/2 cup of the chicken 
        mixture into a half sheet of phyllo and wrap like an egg roll into a neat, 
        tight package. Place the phyllo-wrapped chicken on the rolled dough, and brush 
        the egg white around it.
      </li>
<li>
        Fold the bottom of the dough up onto the phyllo to form the foot of the 
        coffin. Then fold up the sides and top of the dough, pinching it together 
        to make a cross shape on the top. Repeat for each sarcophage. Cover and
        chill in the refrigerator for 1 hour.
      </li>
<li>
        Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Brush the pastry with egg white and bake 
        for 15 minutes, or till golden brown. 18 servings.
